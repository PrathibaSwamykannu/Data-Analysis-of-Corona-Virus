# Data-Analysis-of-Corona-Virus

This is a brief analysis and visualisation of dataset on Corona virus that has affect the huge parts of the world. This is not an 
exhaustive dataset and is growing. 
Packages used :
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. MatplotLib
4. Seaborn
5. Plotly

The dataset is added in this repository. To visualise the virus affected countries on a map, I used an extra dataset called as world_coordinates.csv that hold the latitude and longitude details of the countries. It was merged with the main dataset and then the map visualisation was created using plotly.

It explores the confirmed and recovered cases along with cases that ended up with death. It shows the countries and the provinces/states affected as well. This descriptive analysis gave a lot of observations that helped to understand the impact of this virus.
